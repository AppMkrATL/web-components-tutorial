# Web Components tutorials

This repository contains the code I wrote to go along with [web component posts](https://ayushgp.github.io/html-web-components-using-vanilla-js/). To run the code, you need a static server. I use [static-server](https://github.com/nbluis/static-server) for it. Go to either directory and run:

```
$ static-server
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080).
